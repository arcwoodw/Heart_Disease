This was originally a Codecademy Review Project using hypothesis tests to determine associations between variables. I expanded upon the initial tasks by analyzing more combinations of variables.

The types of tests included in this file are as follows;
1. Two Sample T-test between a quantitative and a binary variable
2. ANOVA followed by Tukey's Range Test between a quantitavive and a non-binary categorical variable
3. Chi-square between two categorical variables
